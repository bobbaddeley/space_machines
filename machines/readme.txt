A plugin for managing machines in a hackerspace, where a machine can be a door, a tool, or anything that requires RFID authorization. Also capable of billing account funds, and showing a special warning shortcode for tools that require training prior to use.

== Description ==

= Including: =
* Machine use widget which shows most recent tool usage
* Requires training shortcode. With [machine_requires_training], it will display a banner that warns visitors that a machine needs training before use.

== Installation ==
1. A couple plugins are necessary. WooCommerce Account Funds, and WP-Members. Account Funds adds an Account Funds field to the usermeta table for users. WP-Members allows you to add additional fields. You'll need to add one that is called 'rfid' and is plain text.
2. Activate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Remove plugin ==

1. Deactivate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Delete plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It's best to use the built in delete function of wordpress. That way all the stored data will be removed and no orphaned data will stay.
